-- Check current auth configuration for OTP settings
-- This is to understand the current OTP expiry settings

-- Note: OTP expiry settings are typically configured in the Supabase dashboard
-- under Authentication > Settings, not through SQL migrations.
-- However, we can check if there are any configuration values stored in the database.

-- The OTP expiry warning typically means the email OTP expiry time is set too long
-- Recommended values are typically 5-15 minutes instead of longer periods like 24 hours

-- This migration serves as documentation that the OTP expiry issue needs to be 
-- addressed through the Supabase dashboard Auth settings, not database migrations.
